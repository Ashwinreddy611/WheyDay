## User Experience 
### First Time Users
* As a first time visitor I would like to get to grips with and comprehend instantly the purpose and intent of the website. This should be communicated clearly
* As a first time user i want it to be simple and easy for me to sort products by various properties such as: price, rating and category. This would then extend to being able to view individual products where I am told everythign about the product including the aformentioned product properties.
* As a first time user I want confidence in my purchasing experience. This would come in the form of a seamless purchase experience, order confirmation and to be able to create a profile where my details can be saved.
* As a first time user I would like to be able to view the social media of the site easily and be immersed in the social side of the company.

### Visiting and Frequent Users 
* As a returning visitor I want to be able to view my profile, change password if necessary and view previous orders. 
* As a returning visitor I would like to be able to email the customer service of the site and that process should be easy and a simple experience. 
* As a returning user the user experience of the site should still be simple in sorting what I would like to view. Navigation should also be easy via the use of pagination.

### Site Owner Goals 
* As a site owner I would like to be able to perform CRUD functionality on the products within the site easily, in the form of adding, deleting, updating and reading.
* As a site owner I would like any emails sent from users via the contact us section to be recieved by my (the site owner) email inbox.
