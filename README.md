## User Experience 
### First Time Users
* As a first time visitor I would like to get to grips with and comprehend instantly the purpose and intent of the website. This should be communicated clearly
* As a first time user i want it to be simple and easy for me to sort products by various properties such as: price, rating and category. This would then extend to being able to view individual products where I am told everythign about the product including the aformentioned product properties.
* As a first time user I want confidence in my purchasing experience. This would come in the form of a seamless purchase experience, order confirmation and to be able to create a profile where my details can be saved.
* As a first time user I would like to be able to view the social media of the site easily and be immersed in the social side of the company.

### Visiting and Frequent Users 
* As a returning visitor I want to be able to view my profile, change password if necessary and view previous orders. 
* As a returning visitor I would like to be able to email the customer service of the site and that process should be easy and a simple experience. 
* As a returning user the user experience of the site should still be simple in sorting what I would like to view. Navigation should also be easy via the use of pagination.

### Site Owner Goals 
* As a site owner I would like to be able to perform CRUD functionality on the products within the site easily, in the form of adding, deleting, updating and reading.
* As a site owner I would like any emails sent from users via the contact us section to be recieved by my (the site owner) email inbox.

## UI
### Typography
*  The "Oswald" and "Oxygen Mono" fonts have been used in order to provide the site with a sleek aesthetic to portray the sit owner's view of WheyDay as the modern and professional buisness it is. These fonts compliment each other in a very sophisticated manner that looks very picteresque for the user. 

### Colours, icons and images
* The colours palette used for the site is a trio of a cold cyan, black and white. The reason being is thee colours lean into the goal of the site being sleek and clean and the arrangement used for these colours does so in a very minimalist manner. 
* The icons chose have come from the site line icons. The reasoning behind this choice is because the style of the icon is very smooth with the smooth curves of the icon that I feel also suppply the same minimalist and sleek look that the font is providing. The icons, colours and fonts are working synergistically.
* The images provided for products have come from the google search for said image and all other images on the site come from unsplash.com.
